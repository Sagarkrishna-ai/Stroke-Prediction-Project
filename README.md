# Stroke-Prediction-Project
I have taken this dataset from kaggle.com 
This dataset is imbalenced .
So i used sampling technique to solve that problem.
I perform EDA using Pandas, seaborn, matplotlib library 
In this I used machine learning algorithms for categorical output like, logistic regression, Decision tree, Random forest, KNN, Adaboost, gradientboost, xgboost with and without hyperpameter tunning I concluded, the best model as GradientBoostingClassifier with best accuracy
